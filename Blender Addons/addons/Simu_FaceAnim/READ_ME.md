# Example Overview
An animator on my team approached me with this problem. He wanted to use Epic's Live Link Face app in Blender. He had an old broken script he found that I used for reference. Live Link Face exports CSV files so I made an addon that reads that data and applies the values to Shape Keys( aka blend shapes in other apps).
