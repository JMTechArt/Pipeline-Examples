# Example Overview
This is an example of a Plug-in tool using C++ instead of Blueprints. This Actor Class creates a grid of points based on the selected input Actor that is already in the level. The grid density is configurable and you can also randomize the location of the points. There is also a seed generator for variation of the same density and random offset settings. It will also update if the input actor is moved in the level. Tools like this example are useful for scattering rocks and foliage.
