From time to time I also implement gameplay code to get visual effects to look correct. The InterpolatedBulwark snippet is an example of that. Bulwark was the name of a character's special healing ability in a project I worked on. The ability shot beams, much like the medic in Team Fortress 2, to heal teammates. The beams would cork screw and randomly moved around in a wave-like pattern. The actual script is much longer and deals with things like server-side code and is left out for clarity.

I lost access to the dev build and this character was never implementated before the studio shut down. There isn't a visual representation unfortunately.
