## Omniverse Replicator and Output Processing Summary

### `omniverse_replicator.py`
This script is designed to work within the Omniverse environment, facilitating the replication of scenes or objects. It automates the process of creating multiple instances of a given object or scene configuration, which can be particularly useful for generating datasets for machine learning training purposes. The script includes functionalities for parameter customization, ensuring that each replicated instance can be varied according to specific requirements, such as position, rotation, and scale.

### `omni_output_processing.py`
This script handles the post-processing of outputs generated by the Omniverse applications. It includes functions to process distance to camera data files and semantic segmentation files. The script converts `.npy` files containing distance data into visualizable `.png` images and processes semantic segmentation `.png` images to attach corresponding legends using label data from `.json` files. This is crucial for validating and interpreting the machine learning model outputs, providing a visual understanding of the data through color-coded depth maps and segmented images.
